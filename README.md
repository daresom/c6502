# c6502
test 6502 emulator

Test emulator for the 6502 processor made in C

Currently I have gotten basic instructions like the load and store instructions working

All instructions have to be hardcoded in `main.c`


# Main.c

For testing purposes, `main.c` contains ~5 tests. An increment and decrement (for the x and y registers) test, and some load tests. The intended results of the tests are shown in comments

# To do

- Literally everything else
